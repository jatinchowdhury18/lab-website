Hi, my name is Jatin Chowdhury! I am a Canadian/American from Denver, CO, where I grew up playing a large amount of both music and hockey. After high school, I moved to Los Angeles, where I studied Electrical Engineering, Physics, and Music Recording at the University of Southern California. I received a Master's degree from the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University, where I studied audio applications of digital signal processing. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology.

During my Master's studies, I started developing and releasing audio plugins, under the name [Chowdhury DSP](https://chowdsp.com). In the time since, I have released several plugins under that name, as well as collaborating with companies including BABY Audio, Schwabe Digital, Bogren Digital, Raytown Productions, and more. A full list of plugins that I have worked on can be found in my [portfolio](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jatin/portfolio/).

I live in Renton, WA with my wonderful wife Livey and our dog Gus. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching and playing hockey, and getting outside for some hiking and camping.
